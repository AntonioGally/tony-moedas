<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Tony Moedas][product-screenshot]](https://tony-moedas.vercel.app/)

I started the "Tony Moedas" project with the intention of improving my technical knowledge in **websockets** and **state management**. I chose cryptocurrencies because I enjoy the subject, so I started looking for some APIs and saw that it was possible to do a lot of cool things using public endpoints/channels. The project currently lists cryptocurrencies and their real-time prices, providing a practical and dynamic view of the financial market. It ended up being a good challenge, both in terms of state management and API consumption. Believe me, the financial market is a mess, just like its APIs :/

This project allowed me to explore the complexities of real-time data consumption and API integration in a modern frontend environment. I continue to improve and expand its features, and I hope you find this repository as interesting and challenging as I did.

But that's the idea, there's more content below :D
